Note that we use the learning platform learn.wu.ac.at for all assignments in this course.\n\n\n\nSummary\nThis course covers the triangulation of the distribution of income and wealth, economic growth and wellbeing, and policy making. The starting point is a broad survey of the recent empirical research on the distribution of income and wealth. Hereafter, we will address the nexus between inequality and economic growth from a theoretical and empirical perspective. Finally, students will discuss the linkage between inequality, political power, and policy aspects. All topics are approached with references to recent publications in scientific journals and a policy-relevant focus.\nTo sum up, students will gain:\n\n\nan overview of the recent empirical research on inequality of income and wealth\na basic understanding of the theoretical and empirical relationship between inequality and aggregate demand\na multi-paradigmatic perspective on power relations and policy debates in economics"

An economy with only a few people should not be automatically judged by the metric as being more equal than a large economy with lots of people.\nScale principle: If every person’s income in an economy is doubled (or multiplied by any positive constant) then the overall metric of inequality should not change.\nDalton principle: In its weak form it says that if some income is transferred from a rich person to a poor person, while still preserving the order of income ranks, then the measured inequality should not increase. In its strong form, the measured level of inequality should decrease.\n\n\n\nReading recommenation: Cowell (2011)"

    "text": "Course design\nThe lecturer introduces the topics and provides an overview of the relevant literature. Specifically, the course offers a summary of applied research on distribution of income and wealth, some theoretical approaches and various policy-related papers. Students are expected to read three papers and write short summaries at home in order to prepare for specific units. Additionally, students will draft a rudimentary research proposal for an empirical study based on the provided starting literature. These proposals will be presented in a poster session. The short presentations should focus on the highlights of an elaborate research agenda and incite discussions in a small-group setting.\nThe course offers a lot of room for discussion in order to permit students to assess various arguments and perspectives, form their own opinion, and argue in a group setting. The teaching is designed to encourage students to actively participate in the debates, raise questions, hone their arguments, and gain experience in drafting research proposals and presenting in a poster session.\n\n\nLearning outcomes\nAfter completing this course, students will:\n\nknow the recent empirical research on the evolution of inequality in income and wealth\nbe aware of the complexity of the nexus between inequality, growth, and policy-related questions\nhave amplified their stock of arguments for economic debates about inequality, power, and growth\nbe capable of presenting their work in a poster session\nbe able to formulate a well-founded research question (e.g. for their bachelor thesis)\n\n\n\nGrading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignments: 30% (0-10 points for each homework)\n\n\n\nPoster presentation: 30% (0-20 points for the quality of the presentation, 0-10 for the poster style and structure)\n\n\n\nEssay/Research proposal: 40% (0-40 points for the essay)\n\n\n\n\n   100-90: Excellent      89-80: Good      79-65: Satisfactory      64-50: Sufficient\nAll single tasks have to be passed (50% threshold each)."
