## Power in mainstream economics I {.medium}

- Power is restricted to monopoly power and bargaining power as deviations in General Equilibrium Theory: Perfect markets are free of power imbalances
- @bawerk:1914: "Macht oder ökonomisches Gesetz" in a controversy with the German Historical School of Economics (esp. Rudolf Stolzmann)
- Perspective: methodological individualism vs. social classes [@rothschild:2002]; Power remains individualised, no institutions or power regimes
- Epistemology: Economics perceives itself as natural sciences (e.g. @lazear:2000: "Economic imperialism")

## Power in mainstream economics II {.medium}

- @samuelson:1957: "Remember that in a perfectly competitive market, it really does not matter who hires whom; so have labor hire capital."
- "Hiring simply means buying": Why should one contracting partner wield more power?
- @alchian:1972: "The firm […] has no power of fiat, no authority, no disciplinary action any different […] from ordinary market contracting between any two people."
- Is there a difference between the relations Shopkeeper-Employee and Shopkeeper-Customer?

## Power between mainstream and heterodox economics {.medium}

- Classical economists addressed the balance of powers
  - Smith: Power balance between social classes
  - Marx: HistoMat, exploitation
  - (Petty, Quesnay, Ricardo, etc.)
- George Akerlof: Asymmetrical information
- Michal Kalecki: Degree if monopoly; Political aspects of full employment
- Bowles/Gintis: The role of sanctions; short-side power
- Political Economy: Relational, strategic, structural power
