#### Course design

The lecturer introduces the topics and provides an overview of the relevant literature. Specifically, the course offers a summary of applied research on distribution of income and wealth, some theoretical approaches and various policy-related papers. Students are expected to read three papers and write short summaries at home in order to prepare for specific units. Additionally, students will present a selected paper provided by the lecturer in a poster session. These presentations should provide an overview of the specific papers and incite discussions in a small-group setting. Finally, students will sum up their findings in a short essay focusing on policy implications of the research.

The course offers a lot of room for discussion in order to permit students to assess various arguments and perspectives, form their own opinion and argue it in a group setting. The teaching is designed to encourage students to actively participate in the debates, raise questions, hone their arguments, and gain experience in presenting in a poster session.

#### Learning outcomes

After completing this course, students will:

- know the recent empirical research on the evolution of inequality in income and wealth
- be aware of the complexity of the nexus between inequality, growth, and policy-related questions
- have amplified their stock of arguments for economic debates about inequality, power, and growth
- be capable of presenting their work in a poster session

#### Grading

- Poster presentation: 40\% (0-20 points for the quality of the presentation, 0-20 for the poster style and structure)
- Essay: 30\% (0-30 points for the essay)
