The starting point is a broad survey of the recent empirical research on the distribution of income and wealth. Hereafter, we will address the nexus between inequality and economic growth from a theoretical and empirical perspective. Finally, students will discuss the linkage between inequality, political power, and policy aspects. All topics are approached with references to recent publications in scientific journals and a policy-relevant focus.\nTo sum up, students will gain:\n\nan overview of the recent empirical research on inequality of income and wealth\na basic understanding of the theoretical and empirical relationship between inequality and economic growth\na multi-paradigmatic perspective on power in economic theory"
